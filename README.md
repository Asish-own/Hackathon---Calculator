# Hackathon Calculator Project

## Overview
This project is a Python-based calculator that offers both simple and multi-operational functionalities. It was developed as part of a hackathon submission. The calculator allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as complex expressions in the multi-operational mode.

## Features
1. **Simple Operational Calculator**:
    - Addition
    - Subtraction
    - Multiplication
    - Division (with error handling for division by zero)

2. **Multi-Operational Calculator**:
    - Allows users to input complex arithmetic expressions, which are evaluated in a single step.
    - Example: `5 + 3 * 2 - 8 / 4`
  
## How to Use

### Prerequisites
